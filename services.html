    <h2>What is Joomla and Wordpress? </h2>
    
    <p>Joomla and Wordpress are web development platforms which in plain English means they are the toolbox holding the tools that will be used to build your website. It's just software, nothing to be nervous about!</p>

    <h2>Why use a CMS? </h2>
    
    <p>There are many reasons why we develop websites in Joomla and Wordpress:
First and foremost, although we are Web designers, you, the client, do not need to be a Web expert to maintain your site once it is up and running. We are able to offer you free Joomla templates. This provides you with significant cost savings in the initial design of your site.
A content management framework is flexible. Not too large for simple sites, not too small for complex sites. As Expert Web designers we are confident we can develop a website that can fit your needs. Joomla and Wordpress provide an excellent platform for growing with your business. In other words, you won't outgrow your website, it will grow with you.</p>
