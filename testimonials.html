        "From design to inception Infinite Color is first rate!  I gave very general guidelines as to what I wanted and the design they developed was spot on.  They were able to take my raw ideas and turn them into an organized, professional, great looking E-Commerce site!  Fast, friendly, and professional responses to requests during development were greatly appreciated.  I would like to say Thank You for a job very well done!"

        Definitely blew away the other Joomla consultants!<br />
        
        I am doing a similar experiment with MediaWiki.<br />
        MediaWiki appears better suited for managing HUGE amounts of content (especially academic/technical in nature)<br />
        
        I will let you know how that goes.<br />

       "I can't believe my great fortune in finding Infinite Color.  I needed to find an expert fast with experience in Joomla to avoid a crisis and you more than exceeded my expectations.  Without any recommendations or referrals, I took a leap of faith and boy did you deliver. You quickly resolved the issue and did so with integrity and honesty, knowing that I was in a bind and not taking advantage of that.  You are a rare find in the programming world and I just can't thank you enough."

Thanks for your expertise in solving our Joomla problems for us.  We had tried several other options before coming to you with little or no success.  You solved the problems quickly and provided clear directions for us to manage our website more productively going forward.  Most important for us as a small nonprofit organization, your final charges were within the estimate you had given us at the outset.  It looks like we're in good shape to move ahead with a more engaging and attractive website, but I wouldn't hesitate to call on your services in the future should new problems or questions arise."
